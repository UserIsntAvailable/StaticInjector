# StaticInjector

A tool to inject public instance methods of a class into a static class using SourceGenerators. This may seem overkill or counterproductive ( since this is pretty much a "Singleton Pattern" that doesn't have the benefit of Singletons, if that makes any sense. ), but I wanted to try out Source Generators, because I really like metaprogramming tools.
